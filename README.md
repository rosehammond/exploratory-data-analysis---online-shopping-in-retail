## Description (what it does, the aim of the project, and what you learned)

Brief: You currently work for a large retail company where you have the task of conducting exploratory data analysis on a dataset of online shopping website activity. With the increasing popularity of online shopping, this dataset provides valuable insights into consumer behaviour.

The project will use various statistical and visualisation techniques to explore the data and draw meaningful insights. The analysis will not only provide a better understanding of customer behaviour but also help the business optimise marketing strategies and improve its customer experience.

The data contains information about the website activity of users over one year. Each sample represents the user interacting with the website during a shopping session.

Overall, this project showcases the power of exploratory data analysis in uncovering valuable insights from large datasets and how to leverage these insights to drive business success.
